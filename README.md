# tower-hanoi-sim

Created 30/03/2025

I was learning about tower of hanoi and was just working in a test file without using git so big first push. I first made a sim with just numbers and then thought about visualizing it more :)! This is hardcoded to size 3!!! Would love to revisit when im better to make it custom size. Still very happy about the result!! I was able to pseudo code tower of hanoi after 2 hours or so of brain frying, needed google to implement it in JS.
